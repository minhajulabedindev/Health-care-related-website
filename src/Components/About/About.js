          {" "}
          Hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with
          specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment.[1] The
          best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically
          has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging
          from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. A district
          hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region,
          with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who
          need long-term care. Specialized hospitals include trauma centers,
          rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric)
          hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such
          as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain
          disease categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care
          costs compared to general hospitals.[2] Hospitals are classified as
          general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income
          received.Currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional
          physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas
          in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of
          founding religious orders or by volunteers. However, there are various
          Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours
          Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as
          well as several other Christian denominations, including the
          Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.[4] In accordance with
          the original meaning of the word, hospitals were original "places of
          hospitality", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some
          institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea, established in 1681
          as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.
